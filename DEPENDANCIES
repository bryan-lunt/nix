### COMPILING ###

dependancies:
gcc
make
gmake
autotools
libtool
pkg-config / pkgconf
openssl
sqlite3
boost / boost-libs
editline
bash 

this source is a little weird; make sure editline is compiled
and installed from source with the parameters:
./configure --prefix=/usr
make SHLIB_LIBS=-lcurses
sudo make install


after installation, be sure to use sudo ldconfig to reload.

make sure to run libtoolize before building all source pkgs

BE WARNED: BASH IS NEEDED CURRENTLY DUE TO BASHISMS IN THE
BUILD SCRIPTS LEFT THERE BY NIX DEVS. MAKE SURE TO RUN 
SH SCRIPTS WITH BASH.
